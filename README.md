## Introduction 

'George Kressler Basic Doll E API Integration Application' is a Python-based application that uses the OpenAI API to generate images using DALL-E. This application is built with Tkinter and provides an interface for generating images based on user-supplied prompts.

This project was made to practice using different types of API's and integrating them into working apps.
